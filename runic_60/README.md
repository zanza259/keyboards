Copy directory `dz60_runic` to the qmk `qmfirmware/keyboards` directory.
(See qmk dev env setup and configuration here: https://docs.qmk.fm/#/)

Once qmk is set up (qmk clones the firmware repo to ~), run the following to compile the keyboard's firmware:
```qmk compile -kb dz60_runic -km default```
